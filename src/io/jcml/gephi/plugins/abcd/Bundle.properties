OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=\
    If nodes are connected when they are enemies, how to represent communities of "friends"?\n\
    This plugin will use the Modularity algorithm to detect communities, but using different edges than the original ones.\n\
    These "friendship" edges exist between nodes that are not too much connected to each other and share the most common neighbors.
